# Camcorder

A simple Web Application to record, watch and upload videos to dailymotion.

The goal is to showcase [`getUserMedia()`][2] & [`MediaRecorder`][3] APIs, and how they can be used to record and upload a video to Dailymotion, directly from the browser.

[Give it a try][1]

## What do you get?

 - A Mobile app. It also works on desktop but the UI is kind of broken...
 - An Android app. Unfortunately Safari iOS doesn't support `getUserMedia()`/`MediaRecorder` yet. So it will only work on Android devices
 - Features :
   - Record a video from the phone camera
   - List recorded videos
   - Watch (in-app), download (on the device) or remove recorded videos
   - Login to dailymotion, upload a recorded video to your account

 - Works _**Offline!**_ :
   - Recordings are save in [IndexedDB][4] thanks to [localForage][5] library
   - Service Workers are enabled thanks to [offline-plugin][6] for webpack + a `manifest.json` file
   - Upload to Dailymotion is obviously *not* available when offline ðŸ˜‰

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` in the newly created folder.
